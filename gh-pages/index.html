<div class="textblock"><p>LVGLPlusPlus aspires to put a C++ wrapper around the LVGL library. It will not support every feature of LVGL as the feature-breadth of the full library is extensive and growing. However, it also does not preclude the co-mingling of this C++ wrapper usage and the underlying library. The user is free to get handles to pointers and use them directly in lv_* calls.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md0"></a>
Goals:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight - no heavy use of memory allocations nor heavy std library use.<ul>
<li>Std library usage is kept pretty much to std::vector, std::string, and std::map</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lower the entry-level 'cost' for new users to be able to utilize this amazing underlying library.</li>
<li>Handle the most common use cases<ul>
<li>Keeps the library smaller</li>
<li>Makes less work to implement it to a steady state</li>
<li>Keeps test coverage more managable if there is only one or two maintainers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hide the intricacies of LVGL behind common methods amongst many of the widget types.<ul>
<li>The lv_* API is large and requires some study to understand. Commong methods amongst several widget types keeps the learning curve lower and the bugs less prevalent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Release Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="release_notes.html">Release Notes found here</a></li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="intro_sec"></a>
Introduction</h1>
<p>I started using LVGL for a hardware design that utilized an ILI9341 TFT touch display. LVGL seemed like the right answer to my needs, but it felt like a learning curve that was fairly steep. Examples were great, but I was failing to understand some of the subtleties that mattered. Ultimately LVGLPlusPlus was borne out of my own learnings in using the library and wanting to be able to consistently utilize it without tripping up over some of the details.</p>
<p>Philosophy - support the biggest common use cases</p><ul>
<li>Create a common set of modifier functions that work regardless of what type of widget</li>
<li>Decomplexify drawing for most cases</li>
<li>Allow use of the underlying lvgl functionality for advanced use cases.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="included_sec"></a>
What's included (today) - and what's not</h1>
<p>As of the first public release in Spring 2023, LVGLPlusPlus, at a high level, has the following included:</p><ul>
<li><a class="el" href="classlvpp_base.html" title="lvppBase is the root of the C++ library LVGLPlusPlus. It strives to create consistent ways to manipul...">lvppBase</a> - A hopefully fairly well designed base class upon which all other widgets sit. It is the intended base gateway to LVGL functionality that both hides some of the details and yet also allows more advanced users access to the underlying object pointers, for instance.</li>
<li>lvppBaseWithValues - A derived class from <a class="el" href="classlvpp_base.html" title="lvppBase is the root of the C++ library LVGLPlusPlus. It strives to create consistent ways to manipul...">lvppBase</a> which is useful for several LVGL widgets such as Bar, Arc, and Slider.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="classlvpp_button.html" title="Basic button class.">lvppButton</a> - This handles the Button and a <a class="el" href="classlvpp_cycle_button.html" title="Derived from lvppButton, this is a button who&#39;s clicks cycle through a list of options.">lvppCycleButton</a> concept.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="classlvpp_full_image_toggle_button.html" title="Button which is all image based and simply toggles on/off between the images.">lvppFullImageToggleButton</a> - Button who's state relates directly to a pair of images.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="classlvpp_image.html" title="Object for loading and displaying an image on a screen.">lvppImage</a> - supporting the placement and rotation of images on screen</li>
<li><a class="el" href="classlvpp_label.html" title="Enable the display of a text item.">lvppLabel</a> - supporting the placement and modification of labels</li>

<li><a class="el" href="classlvpp_roller.html" title="Construct a roller list widget for option selection.">lvppRoller</a> - A widget for choosing amongst a list which scrolls or rolls on the display.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="classlvpp_options.html" title="Utility class to aid in consistent handling of all lv_ widgets which have a list of choices....">lvppOptions</a> - A pure virtual base class that aids in consistency for <a class="el" href="classlvpp_dropdown.html" title="Support for drop-down lists and choosing from a dropdown.

<li><a class="el" href="classlvpp_switch.html" title="On/Off switch widget.">lvppSwitch</a> - The on/off switch supplied in LVGL (allows setting the state, checking the state, and disabling)</li>
<li><a class="el" href="classlvpp_canvas_full_color.html" title="Construct a canvas which uses FULL_COLOR rather than indexed color methods.">lvppCanvasFullColor</a> and <a class="el" href="classlvpp_canvas_indexed.html" title="Construct a canvas which uses INDEXED color rather than FULL color methods.">lvppCanvasIndexed</a> - these two classes support the canvas drawing functionality while hiding some of the more detailed descriptor typedefs/structs and filling them out. Additionally, given that many smaller CPUs lack the memory to have their nice TFT display in full color simply due to memory constraints, the Indexed version of the class provides much of the full color functionality but using an indexed color set. It hopes to help the user in not having to manage their own list of indexed color values and instead handles these internally.</li>
</ul>
<p>While more functions and widgets are coming, I wanted to get this version documented and published to not delay the use of it by folks who might want to pick up and use it.</p>
<p>Some prioritized widgets that will come sooner than later are:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/widgets/core/checkbox.html">Checkbox</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/widgets/core/line.html">Line</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.lvgl.io/8.3/widgets/core/textarea.html">Text Area</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Secondary priorities at this point include:</p><ul>

Getting Started</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2"></a>
How do I use this thing, anyway?</h2>
<p>The project is intended, for most people, to be used from PlatformIO as a library. The library mechanism inside PlatformIO is a beautiful thing. You can go searching for libraries by keyword and get lots of results and then make a decision of which makes sense for you. Adding it to your project can be done from the "GUI" or it can also simply be added to the platformio.ini file in the <code>libs</code> section.</p>
<p>To help facilitate "how to use it", the below mentioned sample projects do include LVGLPlusPlus in exactly this manner. Check out their platformio.ini file or copy the project and use it as a starting space and hack-n-slay from there.</p>
<p>My personal setup is on a Mac M1/ARM running VSCode with PlatformIO. I <em>think</em> the only other additions to my system are around the installation of SDL2 in order to support the native simulator build of the project. I'd love to have someone volunteer to step through that installation and write down any intricacies they encounter so I can get it documented (or they could document it!). The problem I face is that my setup already works and I didn't write down what all I did to get things in place. I do know I used <code>brew</code> to install SDL2, at least.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
Samples</h2>
<p>I've produced two distinct projects as starting points. The two end results on screen look identical, but the underlying difference around threading makes for a few notable differences and I figure folks will gravitate to one or the other. And I didn't want to overly complicate an example with having "both" mechanisms in place as that kinda defeats the purpose of an example being easily digestable.</p>
<p>The two samples are:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bobwolff68/LVGLPlusPlus-NonThreadedSample">Sample Without threading</a> This is the simpler of the two, but I feel it is the one that gives fewer abilities to expand and grow.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bobwolff68/LVGLPlusPlus-ThreadedSample">Sample With threading</a> This version requires the use of my RoboTask threading class and a mutex due to LVGL not being threadsafe, currently. While this adds some degree of complexity, it also allows for your program to be much more thread-oriented without being concerned about which items are interacting with LVGL and which are not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of the sample projects are currently buildable on the simulator for Mac as well as for ESP32 and a TFT ILI9341 display being driven by TFT_eSPI. This is a limited setup for a sample, to be sure, but it's what I have currently so it's what I've been able to put forth. I'd love help from someone to expand these samples to Windows and to other micros, displays, and display drawing libraries to help round things out and make it even more useful to folks starting out from wherever they're starting.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="pattern_sec"></a>
Thoughts on Usage</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
Startup</h2>
<p>The simulator startup is different from that of an ESP32 running Arduino framework. Also, the simulator requires certain SDL2 oriented startup items to get things kicked off. So, the two startups are completely different. I won't go into grave detail on the "how" and the "what" exactly, here, but I'll cover the broad brush strokes and get feedback for what all is really needed in the details. I hope the following is enough bread crumbs to help out. And note, these items are strictly outside of the scope of the LVGLPlusPlus library - I am just hoping to help fulfill that goal of lowering the bar for getting something rolling using the library.</p>
<p>Much of the startup code to bind my use of TFT_eSPI to the project and the use of the simulator / native build came from LVGL's Github as there is a <a href="https://github.com/lvgl/lv_platformio">PlatformIO example</a> which was an excellent starting point for me and where I found the app_hal.* examples.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
ESP32 / TFT_eSPI</h2>
<p>While the <a class="el" href="app__hal_8c.html" title="This file is only used when emulation / native builds happen. Gated on define of USE_SDL in the build...">app_hal.c</a> file is instructional, I think the better way to fully understand the startup and binding with ESP32 and TFT_eSPI would come from looking at my <a href="https://github.com/bobwolff68/LVGLPlusPlus-NonThreadedSample">Sample LVGL Project</a></p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md6"></a>
Use of Screen(s) and Widget(s)</h2>
<p>While you are more than welcome to derive your own classes from the lvpp* classes in order to fully encapsulate them and to have your own callback handlers in your class, I wanted to give a simpler and slicker way to both instantiate and use these classes as simpler objects. I wanted to give the user the ability to control the instance of the object through methods and use lambda functions for callbacks. Additionally I wanted to simplify the grouping and control over setting values without having to keep track of all the pointers to all the objects.</p>
<p>With this foreward, the use pattern I most like (today) is seen in the sample projects primarily in <a href="https://github.com/bobwolff68/LVGLPlusPlus-ThreadedSample/blob/main/src/Widgets.cpp">Widget.cpp</a> and in <a href="https://github.com/bobwolff68/LVGLPlusPlus-ThreadedSample/blob/main/src/TheBrain.cpp#L68">TheBrain.cpp</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Instantiate an <a class="el" href="classlvpp_screen.html" title="The lvppScreen is a non - lvppBase object for organizing the use of multiple screens in a project.">lvppScreen()</a> object. Let's call this your main screen. <div class="fragment"><div class="line">pScreenMain = <span class="keyword">new</span> <a class="code hl_class" href="classlvpp_screen.html">lvppScreen</a>(lv_scr_act()); </div>

</div><!-- fragment --></li>
<li>Now instantiate an <a class="el" href="classlvpp_button.html" title="Basic button class.">lvppButton()</a> object. Give it a name, some text, and then place it on the screen and finally give a callback for when it is clicked. <div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">static</span> <a class="code hl_class" href="classlvpp_button.html">lvppButton</a> setupButton(<span class="stringliteral">&quot;Setup&quot;</span>, LV_SYMBOL_SETTINGS<span class="stringliteral">&quot; Setup&quot;</span>);</div>

<div class="line">    <span class="keywordflow">if</span> (pScreenSetup) {</div>

<div class="line">    }</div>
<div class="line">});</div>
<div class="ttc" id="aclasslvpp_button_html"><div class="ttname"><a href="classlvpp_button.html">lvppButton</a></div><div class="ttdoc">Basic button class.</div><div class="ttdef"><b>Definition:</b> lvpp.h:206</div></div>
</div><!-- fragment --></li>
<li>Next - take this button and add its address to the <code>pScreenMain</code> object for later use. <div class="fragment"><div class="line">pScreenMain-&gt;AddObject(&amp;setupButton); </div>
</div><!-- fragment --></li>
<li>These snips came directly from the referened <code>Widgets.cpp</code> file above. There are more complex examples of an <a class="el" href="classlvpp_bar.html" title="Create a &#39;bar&#39; widget from LVGL and allow range and value to be used.">lvppBar</a> object with ranges and size and values and another <a class="el" href="classlvpp_button.html" title="Basic button class.">lvppButton</a>, <a class="el" href="classlvpp_cycle_button.html" title="Derived from lvppButton, this is a button who&#39;s clicks cycle through a list of options.">lvppCycleButton</a>, and <a class="el" href="classlvpp_dropdown.html" title="Support for drop-down lists and choosing from a dropdown.

<li>Let's show the addition of the <a class="el" href="classlvpp_bar.html" title="Create a &#39;bar&#39; widget from LVGL and allow range and value to be used.">lvppBar</a> object here along with its size, color change, etc. <div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">static</span> <a class="code hl_class" href="classlvpp_bar.html">lvppBar</a> fullnessBar(<span class="stringliteral">&quot;H2OLevel&quot;</span>);</div>

<li>If you've created this <a class="el" href="classlvpp_bar.html" title="Create a &#39;bar&#39; widget from LVGL and allow range and value to be used.">lvppBar</a> which was named "H2OLevel", now from TheBrain.cpp, you can set it's value by only knowing the screen pointer and the name of the object so long as you did do the AddObject() so that the <a class="el" href="classlvpp_screen.html" title="The lvppScreen is a non - lvppBase object for organizing the use of multiple screens in a project.">lvppScreen</a> knows about that object. <div class="fragment"><div class="line">pScreenMain-&gt;setObjValue(<span class="stringliteral">&quot;H2OLevel&quot;</span>, fullPercentage); </div>

<li>Pretty slick, right? I hope folks agree.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="todo_sec"></a>
High level to-do-list</h1>
<p>This is a rather unstructured list of items I'm needing to address:</p><ul>
<li>Add a few images to the main page - logo? links to lvgl with logo ; sample screenshot</li>
<li><a class="el" href="classlvpp_dropdown.html" title="Support for drop-down lists and choosing from a dropdown. Utilizes multiple inheritance of lvppBase a...">lvppDropdown</a> and <a class="el" href="classlvpp_roller.html" title="Construct a roller list widget for option selection.">lvppRoller</a> are similar enough that they should get a common base class for option choosing. This would consolidate much of the getting, setting, and then possibly <em>adding</em> of options by virtue of keeping an internal vector of those options. This would also aid in being able to have a getter for the text value which doesn't have to worry about destination pointer memory overruns but could just pass back a string. In a related matter, lv_dropdown allows for adding singular options to the dropdown, but roller doesn't have the same ability. The consistency of these two widgets could be had by keeping the internal list, and then when a single 'add' is requested in a roller, the entire list could be 'set' again after the 'add'. Additionally the lists could be sorted alphabetically.</li>
<li>There is a need for cleanup on how object styles are used and added and how objects are then invalidated after a change. This is still a fuzzy misunderstanding of LVGL for myself. While it has become clearer recently, some of these objects are still not 'clean' in that regard and may still have misunderstandings buried in them. Fair warning...</li>
<li>Find a contributor with a Windows machine who is willing and able to:<ul>
<li>Take the Mac native simulation configuration and translate that to Windows.</li>
<li>Test against that configuration.</li>
<li>Document any pre-requisite dependencies that had to be installed in the environment to make it work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Build a test-jig program which exercises each of the lvpp* classes<ul>
<li>Possibly utilize <a class="el" href="classlvpp_screen.html" title="The lvppScreen is a non - lvppBase object for organizing the use of multiple screens in a project.">lvppScreen</a> to make each 'unit test' into a screen</li>
<li>Show use of adjacent labels, labels, values, options, different drop-directions, adding full and individual options to selection lists, etc.</li>
<li>Find someone to document the requirements for the test jig.</li>
<li>Find someone to implement the test jig as I think it'll require more time than I (currently) have.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get feedback from anyone who is using the library on a non-ILI9341 display or using a different drawing support method than TFT_eSPI from Bodmer.</li>
<li>Better or more complete handling of what font sizes are handled by setFontSize() without making assumptions of what fonts were baked into the build and which were not.<ul>
<li>Would be great to calculate or measure what font sizes "cost" in terms of build size to give users a good sense of what levers they are pulling and how much each lever costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go through and clean up any printf() items and think about LV_INFO or LV_WARN in its place.</li>
<li>The design of <a class="el" href="classlvpp_full_image_toggle_button.html" title="Button which is all image based and simply toggles on/off between the images.">lvppFullImageToggleButton</a> may be overly complicated or 'manual' as I vaguely remember seeing an lv_create_ construct which might be an ImageButton already. Maybe refactor here.</li>

About Me</h1>
<p>I'm an engineer who started my career, professionally, in 1991. I'm likely the 'old guy' in the room. My hair color proves it. I've been involved in projects ranging from digital hardware design to programmable logic design as well as writing the software that compiled those complex PLDs. My software career has been centered largely around digital video in various forms on PC platforms, consumer platforms, and more recently fully embedded work on micros from Arduino to ESP32 based designs (both hardware and software). Passions of mine revolve mostly around Adventure motorcycling and Burning Man with a sustainability slant.</p>
<p>I found LVGL after I had implemented my own multi-threaded graphics subsystem for my own ESP32-based pandemic "mental health project". It worked and worked well, but the graphics were not pretty as I'm definitely not an artist. When I discovered LVGL, I had embarked on a new ESP32 based design and I dove into implementing the graphics portion for the new project entirely with LVGL. I was blown away at what it could do and do very well, but I was also struck by not fully (or quickly) understanding how styles and some of the handles worked. My project was working but it felt "clunky" and disorganized. I started writing my C++ wrapper for LVGL borne out of this sense of my own disorganization and wanting to simplify my own interfaces to the library underneath. I'm happy to open-source this project and hope that it makes some projects get built quicker and with fewer issues or errors. </p>

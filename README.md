C++ wrapper around the embedded graphics library, LVGL

## Important Resources at the top level
- The full Doxygen-generated docs can be found on my Github Pages at [LVGLPlusPlus Doxygen Docs](https://bobwolff68.github.io/LVGLPlusPlus)
- If you're unfamiliar with LVGL, please go check out the [Main LVGL Site](https://lvgl.io)
  - The interactive forum for LVGL is also an excellent resource. Go check it out at [LVGL Forum](https://forum.lvgl.io/)
  - The main github repo for LVGL itself is at [LVGL Main](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl).
  - The PlatformIO example on LVGL is at [LVGL with PlatformIO](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_platformio)
- The build environment I use is Microsoft VSCode with the PlatformIO extension. This library is a PlatformIO library. The author of LVGL gives some setup advice in the README for [LVGL with PlatformIO](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_platformio)
- I'll be turning on the Github _Issues_ and _Discussions_ features as soon as I can after going live with the public repo.
- Feel free to email me - b o b dot w o l f f 6 8 at g m a i l dot com - happy to entertain questions.

## Mid-range Game Plan

First and foremost - please feel free to use this as is. I'd be happy to hear suggestions and even gain help from others to more fully connect LVGL features to the lvppPlusPlus library.

## Needs/Wants

- I could really use a Windows-oriented person to set a course for building and testing on Windows in the 'native' / 'emulation' mode. I only have a Mac these days so that's become a hole in the overall plan, currently.
- Having a Mac person to go through the steps to setting up the simulator (mostly the installation of SDL2) and writing down that set of success steps would be a great addition as well.

## Contribution and Discussion

Please do strike up a discussion if you have (constructive) ideas. I'm game to brainstorm with positive thinking folks on the structure and how it marches forward.

Thanks!

# LVGLPlusPlus
C++ wrapper around the embedded graphics library, LVGL

## Short-term Priorities

- Publish and open it up publicly
- Document what's here today
- Publish the Doxygen output into the github Wiki to make it easier for folks to peruse what's here and decide if it is something they wish to use in their project(s).

## Mid-range Game Plan

First and foremost - please feel free to use this as is. However, please also note that it is a work in progress. Ultimately, the wrapper suited my direct needs in 2022 but by the end of 2022 I had already recognized some of its areas that needed improvement and some longer-range thought.

Additionally, there are several LVGL object types which are not represented or are under-represented in LVGLPlusPlus and so those need to be addressed as well. I figure the higher priority is to work on a more cohesive plan than lvppBase represents today. It's "ok" but it's not excellent IMHO. 

## Needs/Wants

- I could really use a Windows-oriented person to set a course for building and testing on Windows in the 'native' / 'emulation' mode. I only have a Mac these days so that's become a hole in the overall plan, currently.

## Contribution and Discussion

Please do strike up a discussion if you have (constructive) ideas. I'm game to brainstorm with positive thinking folks on the structure and how it marches forward.

Thanks!
